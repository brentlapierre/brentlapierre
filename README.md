### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to create things for fun - especially when there's a new library or language to try! Currently working on a personal project called [StreamTranslator](https://streamtranslator.com), a translation and text-to-speech service for livestreams. Built in Next.js using TypeScript and Tailwind and utilizing the Azure Speech API Service for text-to-speech. The translation service is built in Python using Hugging Face's transformers library and Meta's m2m100 multilingual encoder-decoder (seq-to-seq) model. The chatbot that sends and receives chat messages on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) is built in Node.js using TypeScript with my [twitch-irc](https://github.com/brentlapierre/twitch-irc) library.

I'm currently open for and seeking new opportunities. Feel free to get in touch with me if you're looking for someone with a lot of passion and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!
