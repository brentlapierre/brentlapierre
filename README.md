### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to create things for fun. Currently working as a freelance Software Engineer, and also in the early stages of starting a new company called [VTuberLabs](https://github.com/VTuberLabs). I'm currently open for new opportunities. Feel free to get in touch with me if you're looking for someone with a lot of passion and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

In my free time I enjoy creating tools like [Twitch.js](https://github.com/brentlapierre/twitch.js), or learning new things tools and languages. I spend most of my time with JavaScript/TypeScript and using React or Next.js.

### You can sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/brentlapierre) if you like any of my work.
